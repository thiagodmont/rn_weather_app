## Cool features explored in this project

Optimized Performance with Repack: Experience faster load times and enhanced performance with lazy loading of screens using Repack, significantly reducing the initial load size.

Modular and Independent Features: Each feature is developed independently, allowing seamless lazy loading and easier maintenance. This modular approach ensures flexibility and scalability for future enhancements.

Self-Contained Navigation: Each feature manages its own navigation, streamlining the development process and ensuring a smooth user experience.

Effortless Styling with Core Components: Built-in styles in core components let you add and customize styles effortlessly, without the need to create separate style objects.
```bash
<Box mh="large" />
```

Simplified Theming with useStyle Hook: Enhance development efficiency with centralized theme management and the useStyle hook, making it simple to apply consistent design elements across the app.

Type-Safe i18n: Benefit from robust translation support with type validation, minimizing errors from misplaced strings and improving the auto-completion experience for developers.

Maintain Code Quality with Custom ESLint Rules: Ensure a clean and maintainable codebase by implementing custom ESLint rules tailored to your project's needs. These rules help enforce best practices, streamline code reviews, and prevent common errors, leading to a more consistent and readable code structure.

Enhanced Readability with Workspace Separation: Organize your codebase with clear workspace separation, making packages more readable and accessible. This approach is especially beneficial for projects intended to be used as a monorepo, enabling better collaboration, streamlined development, and easier maintenance.
